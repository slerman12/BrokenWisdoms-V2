# Prologue

## War

When the Nazis came to Ukraine, they did not arrive as strangers. Long before their boots touched the soil, there were those among the Ukrainians who already shared their hatred for the Jews. The Jews of Ukraineâ€”Ashkenazi Jews, like my familyâ€”were rounded up, tortured, and murdered in cold blood, their bodies left to rot in piles. My grandfather, Yury, was just thirteen when he fled the carnage with his mother, ManÃ¡, and his younger sister, RosÃ¡, escaping eastward to the relative safety of Kazakhstan. When the war finally ended, they returned to Chernihiv, where they found Yakob, Yuryâ€™s father, who had been drafted to fight for Ukraine. He had survived the war, and the years of separation of the wife and children from the father were finally at an end.

By sixteen, Yury had already shed his birth name, "Izya," steeped in the traditions of his Jewish roots, and adopted "Yury"â€”a name better suited for surviving in a dangerously anti-Semitic world. The nickname for "Yury," which he also went by, was "Yura." At sixteen, after his documents had been lost in the chaos of war, he made "Yury" his official name. His last name, however, remained "Lerman," an old Jewish Ashkenazi surname.

## Asya and Yury

After the war, my grandfather attended college in Kiev, while my grandmother, Asya, a "Rabinovich" who had known him in childhood, attended a different college in the same city. A year older than him, they crossed paths once more, and got married. She adopted his surname, "Lerman." Not long after, the Soviet Union assigned my grandfather to work as a leather technology engineer at a sheepskin manufacturing factory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. So, in 1952, my grandparents left Kiev, Zhytomyr, or Chernihiv behind and moved to Samarkand. My grandmother, too, made the journey, finding work there teaching German.

## Sam and Marina of Samarkand and Maracanda 

Samarkand, an ancient city in Uzbekistan, is perhaps the oldest continuous settlement in Central Asiaâ€”[one of the oldest cities in the world](https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/history.htm#:~:text=Samarkand%20is%20one%20of%20the,goes%20back%20in%20remote%20days.). With its [modest yet beautiful architecture](https://travelcocktail.org/samarkand/), it has stood for millennia. In ancient times, it was a vital crossroads where trade routes from [China, India](https://www.britannica.com/place/Samarkand-Uzbekistan), [and Europe](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2015/10/19/samarkand-s-silk-road-treasures) converged. In the Soviet era, Russian became the dominant language, though Uzbek held sway in official documents. Islam, then and now, is the prevailing religion. Samarkand is a city of layersâ€”history, culture, commerceâ€”[a true intersection of worlds](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/603/) both ancient and modern. Its original name, Maracanda, dates back to the 4th century BCE.

My uncle Slava was the first of my grandparents' descendants to be born, followed by my mother, NÃ©lya. Later, through my aunt Jenya, my older cousins Lena and Irina were born, Lena the oldest. My cousins, my sister, and I were all born in Samarkand as wellâ€”all Ashkenazi Jews. When my mother was thirty-three, she gave birth to my older sister, Marina. At thirty-eight, she had me. My sister was named after ManÃ¡, but my mother, wanting something just a little different, chose the name "Marina." My name, "Sam," came about in America, independent of any of us. I was named "SiÃ­myon" after my grandmotherâ€™s sister's late husband, SiÃ­myon, who had passed away years before I was born. Thatâ€™s my full name. "Syoma" is what Iâ€™m called by my family.
