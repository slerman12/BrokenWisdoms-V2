### The Unsampled World at Clover St.

My sister came to our apartment and brought my mom and I to her dark-red mid-size crossover, that I thought looked like a car that symbolized the Devil. Compared to the cars my mom and I drove, it was much newer, much nicer, dark red. She was working as a nurse at the time and making a middle class income. My mom was working two jobs with a low income, and I was a doctoral student.

When we were driving, I remember we stopped at Clover St., due to a red light, and some instinct told me to jump out. The feeling was ominous. But together with that ominous feeling, as the drive progressed, I sensed that a million worlds existed, and that all of them had evolved to converge to this one. So I sat somewhat reassured, in an uneasy anxiety, that what was happening will be okay. 

Except, the sense/vision/idea was wrong, this time. Instead of my fanciful ideas about quantum stochasticity in a single universe, I had this bizarre idea, specifically on this transit, about "Many worlds"—I know, how original. "Many worlds" is a standard interpretation in quantum physics, often an alternative to Copenhagen which also, like me, both usually and <!--I guess--> in my version here, tends to assume a single universe.

In "Many worlds," or at least my version that I was conjuring up in my mind in the car, or I should say was pouring into my mind through a sheer awareness, everything that happened in the universe was evolved, through countless cycles of different trajectories, over cosmogenesis origins upon cosmogenesis origins, into the perfect exact happenings that were happening then. Now that's not really "Many worlds." That's one world, where it just cycles many times, like an AI training algorithm, and we just happen to be in the version that cycled in this way.

"Many worlds" is more nuanced. It says: there's a LOT of worlds—like at least 6. No, maybe a million. No, googolplex. Infinity! Undefined! And we're in this one, because "reasons."

Both of these theories/interpretations are wrong. But neglecting to explain why for now, I think either of these serve as an accessible way to quickly show that, even under a pretty standard physics interpretation, the possibility of "God" is not... I think the word I want to use is "not necessarily stupid."

I mentioned stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics. That means randomness. The universe, as it's theorized today, is fundamentally probabilistic. And physics does a great job of telling us that those probabilities are probabilities. No no, just look at Schrödinger's quantum wave function. See, it's a bunch of probability densities that splash around like a kiddie pool. And when those waves are especially high, that's where the particle is more likely to get sampled, or that's the more likely velocity of the particle, or that's the more likely "World" that gets sampled, or in my especially terrible vision, that's the "Cycle" that the universe just permanently converges to forever. 

So where can "God" fit into any of those interpretations, besides the last one being just "Godawful," no-pun-unintended (my puns are deterministic)? Well, ultimately, something has to select which world gets chosen. One way that could happen is through just the magic power of randomness. Another way, is that some *will* known as "statistical divergence" is able to allocate the probable from the improbable, and, within its holy bounds, tilt the scales a bit. The "Sampler"—who is the "Sampler"?

I sensed an ominous feeling as we were driving, and that same inner sense that gave me that kind-of vision about the many cycling-evolving worlds converging to this moment's exact perfection, told me to make a run for it when we stopped at Clover St., at a red light. My doctoral advisor, Henry, actually lived on Clover St.

My sister's car was big and red, like a giant Dirt Devil, and before we got into it, I immediately had the "Devil" association, appear like a fear in my mind, the first omen (ominous sense) of that drive. Well, the "Sampler" that was about to sample my fate could only have been a little red vacuum cleaner, because, this transit, not specifically just this transit but this transit as well, was taking me to Hell, and the Devil drive did not end on Clover St., nor on the hospital grounds. No, each ticking moment from the drive to the psychiatric unit, even back to home, was a cruise controlled, speed-limit-obeying, insidious, maybe even pleasant drive, deeper, into Hell, to a Hell of mind that only one door leaves.

But at this time, we were stopped on Clover St. And there was my doctoral advisor's big house, on this street, that I could've, hypothetically, run to, in one of the many other worlds. 

My advisor, Henry Kautz, was the most successful man I knew, and his house, I <!--thought-->think, was a mansion (though honestly the one I had on May St. probably would've been preferable).

As my sister must've thought, I'd be getting just standard quality care. What a lucky day. What a lucky world that was sampled. And then we proceeded, from Clover St., to the first day of my benzo nightmare. 

> To do: Technical specifications of "Many Worlds" as an introduction to the study of an intelligent universe, e.g., Tao, through the lens of AI

- ChatGPT claims to use RL
- LLM's "exploration strategy" via beam search type methods can inspire RL
- Applied to RL environments, this equates to the "Many Worlds" concept, except now intelligent, and if differentiable, optimizable towards a purpose
 - And taking inspiration from MHDPA, can be applied to multi-headed particles, as my own theory does
- I studied RL throughout my PhD
 - I did RL my whole PhD
 - Implemented everything
- Was suddenly made credible for the first time thanks to ChatGPT, as my MHDPA research had been made in the earlier years thanks to the explosion of transformers, which also, next to RL for human feedback, underpins ChatGPT
 - And even more recently, has been made more credible with real-time RL robotics (which [I was one of the first to do](#real-time-rl-robotics)), and apparently even OpenAI's "Q*" project, for which the CEO, Sam Altman, was, not long after I was (17 days), terminated

> [!NOTE]
> I felt, ever since that sensation that my tongue was going back into my throat, some vestibular situation—something really changed, and has been different since. That oceanic feeling that John Lennon captured really well about his experiences with TM in the song ["Across the Universe"](https://youtu.be/90M60PzmxEE?si=2n0PJKmeekYA6etl) ([John Lennon wrote the song about TM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe#Composition), both explicitly in his reference to "Jai guru deva om" and more ambiguously with his spot-on description of the state of consciousness induced by and, with respect to the mantra, during, TM) was gone. Since that "catatonia" (tongue-throat situation), my experiences/words during and following TM weren't "like endless rain into a paper cup." They had become coarse somehow, and instead of that vibrant "Kundalini" movement I felt before, there was a physical feeling in my neck, a right-angle tilt, even when I wasn't meditating. I first began noticing this while trying to meditate in the hospital at RGH.

Since RGH<!--After the Christmas, 2018 trauma-->, I wasn't able to access my meditation anymore.

The meditation still relaxed me. I still felt less social anxiety afterwards. It still gave my thoughts more peace. But physically, it felt neither like bliss nor like a body part that I directly controlled. I couldn't maneuver the breath, kundalini, blood circulation, whatever it was, through the different areas of my physical psyche (and actual body), and my given mantra, that I repeated silently in my mind as part of the meditation, didn't carry itself to the same places of acuity that it naturally did before, where rather than the hard sensation of speaking my inner voice that now characterizes my mantra's audition, the mantra had before "tapped," "dissolved," become so soft until it literally couldn't be heard except in awareness and all of my thoughts were then fully adherent to both my will and my natural rhythm, and no energy was lost no matter how verbosely or viscerally I thought then, and each one came like ["endless rain into a paper cup,"](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe%23:~:text%3DThe%2520flavour%2520of%2520the%2520song,the%2520link%2520to%2520the%2520chorus.&ved=2ahUKEwjGvszQ1rOIAxXlhIkEHdwgLcwQFnoECBsQAw&usg=AOvVaw1MtnfbSbXSsMu_w1lg6V_v) where just the [right word](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9), or visual or association, corresponded to both my will and my rhythm, beautifully, sometimes blissfully, sometimes catastrophically<!--, maybe even orgasmically-->.

In my second hospitalization, the environment was much better than RGH's. I made friends with Sarah, Hudson, and other inpatients. We [played](https://youtu.be/cco_DvSzrts?si=pmfrQ4XEaLF1teEK&t=51) Guitar Hero together, there was a piano, there were TVs, one of the public rooms had big windows, we even were taken across floors of the hospital for music jamming sessions with lots of instruments, they had their yoga and meditation instructions as well, and of all of my hospitalizations to come, this was perhaps the best care unit I was gated by armored vault into. 

Sarah's sister's name is "Kundalini Grace." I hadn't heard of "Kundalini" until after I had those visceral, physical sensations in the House on May St. Then I looked up those sensations I was experiencing and found, for the first time, not having heard the word or of those movements and sensations before, the term "Kundalini," made more credible to me by the philosophy's appreciation by the depth psychologist Carl Jung, who I was reading at the time, and whose views, very distinct from Freud's, on the existence of a subconscious, and its mystical-transcendent connection, helped explain some of what I was witnessing.  

Sarah Young's last name is "Jung," she hadn't heard of Carl Jung, she and I kept observing synchronicities while we were there, and she kept a synchronicity list. To me, no synchronicities happened yet that were bigger than just the uncanny precision and specificity of the I Ching's answers. However, I was still seeing some unambiguous synchronicities, as well as not seeing many others, including that the word "synchronicity" was actually coined by Jung, and now I was remarking on them  together with one Sarah "Jung." But there were more I hadn't seen, and more, much bigger, that would come.

The House on May St., in retrospect was one big synchronicity. I got the Facebook student housing page moderatorship just before I had to move out, and was able to deliver on my promise to fill my landlord's house (and houses) with grad students. Not to mention, the house itself. Having that whole house, pretty much to myself, a beautiful antique house, for relatively pennies, the same house I had my AI and physics revelations—"luck" seems to forget a lot of context.

So the word "synchronicity" was already familiar, as was Jung, as was Kundalini, as was Grace, by the time Sarah and I met in the hospital. 

Sarah was early 20s, by chance hospitalized at the same time as me, also early 20s. She was a year older. 

We played Guitar Hero, I continued all of my meditation and yoga regimen, and my family, including my mom, uncle and aunt, and cousin brought in Paleo diet food for me, which I ate for my eczema but which also helped with my cognition, instead of the unhealthy processed type food of the hospital. And I shared crapes with Sarah<!--(another inpatient)-->, that my aunt brought in each time she and my uncle visited. They weren't 100% Paleo (buckwheat, goat cheese), but still delicious.

So to summarize, I was doing daily meditation, twice a day, daily yoga each morning, and eating a Paleo diet in the hospital, as well as now socializing well. On top of all of that, and antipsychotics, surely the missing ingredient to cure me would be an involuntary >6 months course of benzos.

My brother-in-law came in with my sister and I explained to him relational reasoning and the paper I submitted, the method of MHDPA. I explained to him the method underlying ChatGPT from my hospital ward 4 years before ChatGPT. And at the time, he thought my explanation was cool, but it'd've been hard to predict would be such a big thing, one that others in my field and the world would have heard of or have anywhere to as much belief in the utility in AI of, in the near-term or in the years to come. It was hard to predict for my professors and faculty, too. At the time, 2018/early-2019, most at the University of Rochester still thought deep learning was a fad. None of the professors or other PhD students were doing research on MHDPA, let alone had heard of MHDPA. [They might claim otherwise](4-Faith.md#academia--medicine). Besides the paper that proposed MHDPA itself, my innovation to MHDPA, was the first innovation to MHDPA ever, in the world/history. A small handful of others applied it, from research groups in DeepMind, none literally innovated *on* the method.

I showed my MHDPA innovation paper to Sarah. She was amazed that she could read it since usually, she said, that kind of stuff isn't readable, and brought up one more synchronicity. Her mom was a writer who had a published short story in a Stephen King anthology, a writer of horror. I was indeed in a hospitalization that was like a pretty good short story in an otherwise Stephen King anthology/horror. 

Not that my lucidity needed further evidence, but I explained the methods of late-2022 ChatGPT to inpatient and visitors, in early-February, Winter, 2019, while drugs were altering and innovating on the functioning of my biological neural networks.

#### Hudson

Our other companion was Hudson, who caught me as I was being discharged and handed me this letter in an envelope, that I opened later from my apartment:

<p align="center">

</p>

It's great<!--I'm impressed--> he was able to write at all. He had depression, was in the hospital for depression, was being treated for depression, was medicated for depression, and was electroshocked weekly, for depression. 

Meanwhile, I was being brain damaged by benzos, but who could've known that? (I did, because I made the case articulately, sufficiently so, to all of my psychiatrists. As I predicted, longer-term benzo use is dangerous, causes extreme physical dependence, and can result in unthinkable suffering). 

I was told a court order would be acquired if I didn't take them, even as I was taking antipsychotics.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Jeremiah
>
> I ordered a margarita in a 2016 birthright Israel trip (a program that I really like, since otherwise I might've not been able to afford to go on any vacations), with Jeremiah probably somewhere at the table, thinking I was ordering a drink, and they brought me just this big margherita pizza. That's a fun story. Combined with benzos, that is, if I took my prescription for social anxiety that day, I suppose the effect would've been worse, neurologically and physically, than if they brought me a margarita.
>
> That was also the trip where I was complaining [my hair was too long](https://www.facebook.com/share/qQqsQLv4Cgvbv7UZ/) (as many people heard/"witnessed"), perhaps another almost-preternatural-seeming omen, besides the electric razor breaking, that preceded the [very vivid nightmare that I had](#part-1) and me growing out my facial hair (beard and mustache) for the first time, by chance.
>
> And we all got extremely sick, suddenly, everyone on our bus, 10 plus people, 10 - 30 people, originating from a guy on the trip who wasn't me or Jeremiah. My cousin Irina, who went with me, and I, got the most sick, of the whole bus, really severe fever, sneezing, sinuses, coughing, vomiting, more. I recall she was even prescribed an opioid, besides Sudafed.
>
> About two years after my first Strong Hospital hospitalization, Jeremiah, who I hadn't seen since the trip to Israel, commented on a Facebook post that I'd made about the trauma that benzos induced on me, about some of his experiences. He wrote publicly on my post about how some psychiatric medication he had to take caused him to have a seizure. "[...] I've had bad side effects from medications that caused me to have a seizure one time that was no fun. [...]" Benzos, one of the drugs he was prescribed and the only plausible culprit of the ones he told me, [cause seizures during the brain's GABA downregulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21815323/#:~:text=Withdrawal%20seizures%20have%20occurred%20with,time%20and%20at%20high%20doses.), a widely suffered and standardly known side effect of longer-term benzo use. Those were almost definitely the medication <!-- of his--> he was referring to.
>
> He also wrote how he was held down and choked, on pavement outside, after being tackled, on the hard rough pavement, by the university-hospital police officers, when he tried to make a run for it. "I tried to escape and they held me down and choked me. I got to the driveway [...]" Analogously, my next hospitalization also involved combative resistance to hospitalization, following the >year of benzo-induced torture. In October, 2020, I was also physically coerced by the police, due to having a "breakdown," I suppose it can be called—quiet, peaceful, and spiritually-guided—in the grass of my apartment complex, where I'm pretty sure I was legally allowed to, or within perimeters. Efforts to escape medical custody might have other causes besides bravery and spirituality (if one is willing to extend the benefit of the doubt that I'm not stupid), for example (1) induced by disinhibitions from prescribed pharmaceutical drugs, or (2) the quality of the care provided within medical custody, or other snowballing longer-term medical-institution causes, such as (3) resistance due to earlier trauma from a previous medical intervention, like the benzo coercion that traumatized me. So, in consequence, the medical application of police brutality can result as one of the negative side effects of a pharmaceutical drug, wherein the medical system is committing physical violence in order to reinforce the drug, care, or practice that led to their own physical violence or the patient's combative resistance. They also are very coercive inside the hospital, especially in the early transit before the psychiatric unit, e.g., making you sit in one place, wear what they want you to wear, take the drugs they give you or otherwise be injected with them, etc.

#### From RL to "Many Worlds," and Other Research

Before my area exam, I was building a vision transformer for generalizing across Sonic the Hedgehog levels, but I didn’t realize it was a vision transformer (in the Computer Vision domain) since it was purely applied to reinforcement learning, and the crux of it for me was to use disentangled relational representations as queries to the episodic memory (k-nearest neighbors, made differentiable via weighted averaging attributed rewards), meant to give the episodic memory more generalizability since the relational representations extracted parts and their relations rather than the full entangled context, effectively treating the MHDPA heads like an ensemble of independent memory queries using my disentangling method from my earlier paper. This is still an extremely insightful symbolic understanding of how models can generalize across domains, where the relational representations are the generalizable components and the episodic memory was like the parameterized or recurrently-stored knowledge trained into models today via giant data corpora, except in both cases more explicitly programmed in as novel inductive biases. None of this was appreciated by my department, whatsoever. 
- I was studying reinforcement learning (RL), from DQN, to policy gradients, to actor-critic, since the beginning of my PhD. It was at the forefront of my research, but completely unsupported and un-believed in until ChatGPT, which, besides MHDPA, was able to train human feedback into the model via an RL type algorithm, not exactly reinforcement learning since N-step future rewards aren't used—more like moving parameters in the direction of a gradient to maximize outputs that are assigned higher rewards by humans—analogous to policy gradient methods in RL—but enough to lend credibility to RL's utility for the first time in my PhD. The models that succeeded ChatGPT may have been less simplified, using actor-critic type behavior maximization rather than policy gradients, which are a little weaker. The full potential of RL, using N-step reward, over long time-scales, online learning, and multi-agent, is still unrealized. Exploration sampling is analogous to beam search type methods, and the latter could be applied, hypothetically, to environments in RL, as is actually the best technical analogy for "Many worlds."

<!--
Also before my area exam, I taught Henry "sequence-to-sequence attention" from my office, in a state of misery that I couldn't convey, as I was also working on further innovations to MHDPA, now suffering due to grad-level classes, TAship, impending area exam, and the brain damage. I tried to tell Henry what was going on and he couldn't understand the severity, giving me an anecdote about his son's medication.

Henry edited down my MHDPA innovation paper to submit to a workshop, cut down some pages, and I submitted it. It was rejected. At this point, I myself, like Henry, doubted that the paper really had value. Amid my brain damage, there was nothing but despair.

### Area Exam (and All As)

#### Flying Colors

<!--
The first psychiatrist was young, soft and gentle-eyed. Maybe not a rookie, but close enough to still have enthusiasm. The kind of guy who wears his scrubs like he’s one step away from happy hour, the sort who still remembers what it was like to be human and not just some overworked automaton. I walked with him down the hall, and I think he thought I was sharp. I think he thought I was actually interesting to talk to. And sure, I was under the sweet haze of benzos, so I felt sharp. It wasn’t so much my intellect as it was the way the drug draped everything in a golden glow. I was brilliant. I was lucid. My thoughts were all connected in this colorful, radiant thread that I could almost touch. I was the goddamn sun. I was a walking TED Talk. Let's call this luminescence, "flying colors"—a term stolen from Henry.

I convinced him—or perhaps he would’ve agreed with my worry anyway—and he reassured me that I’d be weaned off the drugs before discharge.

A week or two later, the second psychiatrist entered. She was an Asian woman, stern and astute, detached and efficient. After glancing at my chart, she said the tapering schedule was too fast, and that the outpatient psychiatrist would handle it after discharge. The first psychiatrist, self-doubting, noticed my worry and emphasized that he had intended to taper me off before discharge. She dismissed his effort. She disagreed and reassured me that I’d be tapered right after discharge.

The benzos were prescribed without any effort to learn what had been happening with me, and this lack of investigation was on top of me being given Risperdal, a strong antipsychotic.

It was at the forefront of my research, but completely unsupported and un-believed in until ChatGPT, which, besides MHDPA, was able to train human feedback into the model via an RL type algorithm, not exactly reinforcement learning since N-step future rewards aren't used—more like moving parameters in the direction of a gradient to maximize outputs that are assigned higher rewards by humans—analogous to policy gradient methods in RL—but enough to lend credibility to RL's utility for the first time in my PhD. The models that succeeded ChatGPT may have been less simplified, using actor-critic type behavior maximization rather than policy gradients, which are a little weaker. The full potential of RL, using N-step reward, over long time-scales, online learning, and multi-agent, is still unrealized. Exploration sampling is analogous to beam search type methods, and the latter could be applied, hypothetically, to environments in RL, as is actually the best technical analogy for "Many worlds."

<!--
Also before my area exam, I taught Henry "sequence-to-sequence attention" from my office, in a state of misery that I couldn't convey, as I was also working on further innovations to MHDPA, now suffering due to grad-level classes, TAship, impending area exam, and the brain damage. I tried to tell Henry what was going on and he couldn't understand the severity, giving me an anecdote about his son's medication.

Henry edited down my MHDPA innovation paper to submit to a workshop, cut down some pages, and I submitted it. It was rejected. At this point, I myself, like Henry, doubted that the paper really had value. Amid my brain damage, there was nothing but despair.

#### Step by Step<!--Classes, Paper, and Research-->

Amid the first months of the course of benzos, as my cognition was fading and world was gray, but not yet at my most severe, the demands of the Spring, 2019 semester were afoot.

My uncle told me, "step by step." Each day I worked, a little at a time.

I had grad-level classes that I had to pass after being hospitalized during the early part of that semester, was TA'ing Philosophy of Consciousness, had research I was still trying to do, and spent every day writing a little bit towards my area exam paper.

The area exam is the biggest defense besides the thesis, a big many-page paper, and an in-person presentation and oral defense.

I spent each day writing, step by step.

#### Outpatient Doctor

After I was discharged, the color film had faded, the "flying colors" had faded. It was Oz in reverse. The psychiatric unit was the "Wonderful Land of Oz," with me colorfully drunk on the magic benzos they were giving me at threatened risk of court order, and by the third "healer's" pen click, the tornado had begun. The third psychiatrist, the outpatient doctor, also University of Rochester, was categorically, unarguably bad. If there could be a DSM-5 yellow-brick-manual definition for bad, it would just be a picture of him. In the second month with him, 3 months into the benzos, my cognition was not just grey but Requiem For A Dream-grey, anxiety constant. [My memory, speech, and imagination were gone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef90661-f01c-40bc-b8b9-b0a101b80d92). From his disbelieving clinical authority, all of my symptoms were, wrongly, attributed to the earlier diagnoses. 

<!--The Hell was indescribable, literally. Attempted to write it 500 times. I'll put it in the "Benzo Torture" document. It was like Schindler's List-grey, not even a little girl carrying an umbrella.-->

#### Classes and Discipline

I got extensions for one class, help from another PhD student on one or two problems for the homework and with understanding material from another class, and visited one of the professors at his office hours for help as I was running late due to the hospitalization. I scored straight As. This<!--, area exam work, and research--> took spirit and luck, as well as my continued disciplines, including <!--**-->daily meditation, strict Paleo diet, cold showers, and Wim Hof method; and asceticisms, including no movies, TV shows, etc.<!--**-->, human spirit that should not be underestimated, yes, amid brain damage and torture<!--, and—most certainly not Paleo—having to consume nearly half a gram of benzos in total over the course of these few months, deleteriously racing away the benefits of each of these disciplines-->.

It's the hardest thing, to describe how I can get all As and do extraordinarily well in a semester under the conditions <!--I described earlier. That is what my family is like.--> of the benzo nightmare.

<!--
During one meeting, I taught Henry "sequence-to-sequence attention" from my office, in a state of misery that I couldn't convey. In that meeting, I tried to tell him what was going on and he couldn't understand the severity, but gave me an anecdote about his son's medication. Henry was beyond supportive, and I feel bad that he was powerless in helping me beyond how much he did. Actually. This isn't an indictment of him.
-->

#### Brain Damage

I told the third psychiatrist I thought I was brain damaged, and that I was in physical pain, that I had [tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/), and that I'd read from multiple scientific studies that [brain damage from benzos may be permanent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/), and he didn't care about the [many scientific studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15762814/) I may have hypothetically read, because every word I said was devoid of believability—not colorless from outside, but agitated/irky/murky, like my inner anxiety was attacking him. So he reacted by saying that increasing the dose would be the best course of action. I begged him to taper, and he said if I was having all those negative symptoms, that he should increase the dose. Out of fear that he would, I had to withold the intensity of how I expressed my active experience.

Starting some months [(maybe 4th month) into taking the benzos](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/), I was laying on the couch, immobilized, shaking with excruciating agony. No sleep, no escape. No exit, just PhD work, literally fighting through peak of human spirit, in torture. All color gone, all imagery, all imagination, only pain, perpetual pain and fear. Terror. Terror terror terror. I remember one day trying to do $4*7$, and not being able to. 

I saw him for about 4 or 5 months and don't remember his name, my cognition was so greyed.

[Nobody understands neurodegeneration](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5), but what I suffered was physical brain damage.

Besides [tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/): [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), [wrinkles](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and mouth dryness added to the mounting evidence of damages happening not just to my psyche, but to my body's physical and neurological structure.

Henry had said, empathetically, "You look terrible."

#### Rehearsal in Front of Uncle and Mom

At the end of the semester, it was time to prepare for the oral presentation portion of my area exam.

I rehearsed the area exam presentation in front of my mom and uncle for a week, a couple or more times each day, for each day before the morning of the in-person area exam defense with the faculty, of whom there would be 8 or so. Since I could barely think, remember, or go a moment without wincing pain, I planned take my benzos on the day of the exam at a higher dose than usual, in order to be able to function, as the symptoms of the downregulation were now beyond severe. To prepare and test the efficacy of an increased dose, I rehearsed one day in front of my mom and uncle for them to evaluate, to test first that it helped. They knew. Both dosings were intelligently planned and necessary for my functioning. 

Amid the grey, the cognitive decline, and the shaking anxiety of the state of my brain's GABAnergic system, they were also necessary to the treatment of my social anxiety, heightened by the induced impairments and tortures, which is what they were originally prescribed to me for, in college, before the "catatonia" misdiagnosis. 

It's unethical that I had to take them to meet a requirement, given the context of not wanting to be on them in the first place, and the same university that induced the trauma being the one now evaluating me for that requirement. The coercions snowballed, little did the different branches of the university realize.

My benzo torment lasted for more than a year, and in that time, I had to take an irregular dose one other time. This other time was to give [the poster presentation for the Med Center](#charles-venuto) at a conference in DC, which has since benefited me in no way, the one where I also presented the website I built, also a high dose, also unwanted, also necessary to my basic functioning under that <!--socially and performatively-intensive--> task.
<!--, since that also involved cognitive performance in front of down-looking authorities in a higher-pressure requirement with no other non-risky alternative. Rewinding to main timeline...--><!-- later, where at the conference I presented my website and prototype, that I had to build while under all of these work, hellmouth, and hellfire conditions, that they liked, all were impressed by, hired a team for, and didn't credit me.-->

#### Inability To Defend 

I was in more cognitive decline with each passing psychiatrist. The euphoria was turning into grey cloud and fog, more cognitive impairment, anxiety, excruciating anxiety, and [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), which persisted for more than a year.

He wanted to increase the dose, as if that would reduce my brain's increasing system-wide downregulation of GABA, rather than worsen its effort to fight the dysregulation. In case you're wondering, he was an idiot. The brain damage, and literally — when memory, speech, and imagination are all impaired, and the patient's in pain, *the brain is damaged* — risked being permanent and irreversible, according to [(many) studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15762814/) I found and the [fact that nobody understands neurodegeneration](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5). 

I write this with the same truth value as "the Holocaust was bad": I should've weaned myself off then, or better yet, immediately, as soon as I could've started weaning. The brain's GABA being downregulated is like living in an active war zone. Coercively induced, it is, without exaggeration, a legalized form of torture, neurochemical waterboarding, except the effect persists beyond each cranium drowning, without a moment's break for air. By the next month with that doctor, around month 4 of the benzos, I wasn't able to recall well even important personal memories or easily do basic math, grey cognition, non-stop anxiety, non-stop torture. My writing quality went extremely down on anything that was social or creative or new. What I suffered was physiologically brain damage. 

My cognition and perception deteriorated severely, and [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), [tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/), mouth dryness, and [wrinkles](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) added to the mounting evidence of damages happening not just to my psyche, but to my brain and body. I was in severe pain and agony. He responded with only authority, no reasoning, and no sensitivity. He didn't believe any of my arguments. He made no consideration to the possibility that I was right or he was wrong. His clinical authority meant more to him than my agony. His perpetuation and amplification of my suffering, attributed reasons (despite good arguments that I made, but which were too agitated for the foolish authority), and fears was afforded to him only by his disbelief and my drug-induced insecurity about weaning off by myself. The third psychiatrist, is like Schindler's List-grey, like not even a little girl carrying an umbrella. <!--I saw him for about 4 or 5 months and don't remember his name, which is too bad, or I would write it here in capital letters.-->

What goes beyond the articulation of the dangers of benzos, or the inconsistencies between the psychiatrists, is that the entire administration of the benzos, which became traumatic, was based on a false premise. Adherence to yogic-type experiences—whether or not they were delusional, whether or not they were safe to intervene on with drugs—is not the same as "catatonia." But the real issue isn’t just the misdiagnosis of “catatonia”—it’s that no one bothered to investigate the cause behind it.

To explain that or anything to them, the pressure was higher with each subsequent psychiatrist because my "flying colors" were increasingly faded, turned to fiery pain. The preceding trauma took the last 5 years for me to process into a form that I could write, let alone speak, let alone boil down into a spoonful under pressure. Depending on which version of this book you are reading, the description of that crisis might be largely omited, here.

My "flying colors" were increasingly faded, the clarity, the ease with which I could make my case, <!--impoverished and--> starved. And with them, my ability to defend myself was diminished. If "flying colors" couldn’t carry me through these clinical encounters, I was left to the mercy of whatever was written on the page of my medical records—unless some shred of my credibility could pierce through their established protocols. The longer I stayed on the drugs, the harder it became to make my case and more necessary. Each passing day carved through my capacity to advocate for myself, while the pressure to convince them to stop the drugs, as their effects on and in my body accumulated, mounted.

#### Oral Defense

At the area exam, I presented word by word as I rehearsed. 

Henry, compared to other professors of similar rank ([one of the highest in the world in AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kautz)) and background (symbolic reasoning, or, more fittingly to this book, perhaps, ["worst-case"](https://henrykautz.com) problems), deserves credit for not thinking deep learning was a fad, and had some intuition about ideas like the biologically-inspired neuron in the diagram [above](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), though not always of involved ideas, like the use of attention mechanisms (e.g., MHDPA). 

The person who will be my next advisor (see ["Red light at Clover St."](#red-light-at-clover-st)), was my machine vision professor from my first year, Chenliang Xu, technically not in the room during the area exam, and was answering the Skype call from China. He was the only person in the meeting who asked for elaboration on how I planned to do "relational representations" for vision with image features from a CNN, since he didn't know what MHDPA was (neither did my NLP professor in the semester before my hospitalization) and I went back to slide 11 and re-described MHDPA to all of them again, and the fact that Chenliang was the only one of them who showed interest in the method that most revolutionized the next years of their fields, is a synchronicity, because, due to causes that were independent from the area exam, he will become my later advisor (see ["Red light at Clover St."](#red-light-at-clover-st)). 

I was more than capable of tackling any challenging question about any of the specifics of my work, or even something more philosophical and profound, thanks especially to this moment of remission from the months of excruciating agony, as benzos draped the air with bursting rainbows of GABA once more.

<!--He was satisfied with my answer because I answered it well, but in all likelihood he didn't remember.-->

#### with Flying Colors

I passed my area exam, for which I had to write that 30ish page paper amid those courses TAshing, and my research, within a few weeks of the close of the Spring, 2019 semester, "with flying colors" according to Henry.

The other faculty were probably mostly impressed by my "flying colors," as my personality was made vibrant by the benzos I had to take at a higher dose that morning to function, but that’s not how Henry meant it.

[My slides for that area exam were also quite colorful](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing), also not how Henry meant it.

That semester, Henry had helped me rework my MHDPA innovation paper into a workshop paper. He pretty much cut it down himself, edited it, and put together something short that can be submitted to a workshop. It was really short, and I wasn't sure would still make sense, but my cognition wasn't good enough, nor did I have the time this semester, nor was I physically strong enough, to do more than what Henry did, and amid my agonized state, I actually had no faith in myself, and after the first rejection, I wasn't sure where the work stood in terms of actual importance or just crazy exalted projection from psychosis. I was really grateful for Henry reworking it himself. It wasn't his fault it still got rejected. Much was truncated to fit the workshop required page limit, including much of the early motivation. After the area exam, he sent me this email:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Congratulations again on knocking it out of the park at the Area Exam!
>
> I wish I had not discouraged you from submitting the full version of your paper to the actual ICML conference, but you'll be able to submit it somewhere later this year.  In my defense, I never really "got" what you were doing until your presentation this morning!
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

And I replied:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> This means a lot to me. Thank you so much, Henry.
>
> Although, I’m not totally sure the paper will get accepted to the ICML workshop - I don’t think I motivate it well.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

Charles also sent me an email:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Nice job this morning.  I along with the other committee members were impressed with your presentation and overall approaches. Exciting work ahead! 
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$
> 
And by chance, since the other 7 faculty didn't, Chenliang CC'd me on his confirmation:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> I attended Sam's area exam and approved the assessment made by the committee.
>
> Chenliang
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

My uncle was worried I wouldn't pass, and we all celebrated joyfully that I did. The area exam is the University of Rochester CS department PhD program's biggest defense other than the thesis. Students are awarded a master's degree for a successful area exam defense, which includes the 30ish-page paper I wrote and oral defense<!--, which in my case included many faculty,-->. What it took was my earlier stock of genius, and through an extremely dedicated human spirit fighting literal brain damage on will alone, I wrote a genius paper that probably none of them read, and took a big dose of benzos to present it, passing with "flying colors," officially a master's student at extreme torture, Spring, 2019, celebrating uncharacteristically high afterwards. 

My family besides me also have higher-level degrees. My mom, a master's degree in music theory. My uncles Slava and Sasha, PhDs, in physics and mathematics, respectively. My cousins, PhDs in dermatology and pharmacology. My sister, nurse practitioner (master's degree). And my best friend, also in a PhD program (immunology) but in another city. All were proud of me. None knew all the details of the hospitalizations. Henry of course didn't either. This book is the real-time processing of that memory and the rest of these memories, all traumatic and extremely hard to write (see the number of commits this book has, look through the commits to see how hard I struggled to express any of this, and other versions of this book in other repos and on my other GitHubs, maybe that I will make private, where some of this effort to describe and editing also took place), into writing.

### Hell

#### Grey, and GABA Downregulation

At after the 6 month point, I started gradually reducing the dose, now entering the ["hungover" chemical waterboarding phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/).

They say the only thing to fear is fear itself: GABA downregulation is fear itself. The experience is like being in a warzone. It's like burning alive—without stop—more than a year, torture. The neurochemical experience is literally what you go through if you're in a warzone, and being chased by a predator, while in the middle of having a seizure: hellfire, indescribable pain. I remember staying up nights shaking, just shaking, electricity swarming through me, my face curled, deformed as I tensed and agonized all night unless I got some sleep if I was lucky and then waking up feeling like that, again, for the rest of the day, every day, for months like this. 

[Even at lower comparative doses than what I took, by people who are seen as teachers of manliness,](https://youtu.be/laheAXdZK7w?si=FuPXGh1cLuuvtfHW) this experience of misery and crippling agony is experienced.

Skin dry, teeth calcifying (at a dental cleaning appointment, the hygienist diagnosed it as calcification and the attributed cause as dry mouth due to benzodiazepines), no memory, no linguistic expression, cognition completely grey and burning. 

I remember trying CBD oil or L-theanine to try to sleep. Latter didn't work—the CBD oil, which I got from that herbal apothecary near the house on May St., when I stopped in because I didn't know that building had become a herbal apothecary, helped a little, and after I talked with the store workers about the different herbs and chemicals they had with probably way more knowledge than they expected, the person at the counter asked to add me as a friend on Facebook, which was serendipitous and miraculous for me, but then she stopped replying as soon as I messaged suggesting they host meditations in the park next door because my wording/thinking was probably [awkward](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/), due to literal brain damage from the benzos. The personality consequences of the extreme [anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/), [brain fog](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/), and [impaired speech](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d), plus total hair loss, harmed my social life more than can be stated, and lasting trauma regarding people from the interactions with the psychiatrists and medical staff coercions.

These symptoms [persisted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dyaf8n/constant_chest_pain_that_spikes_into_my_neck/) for more than a year, and the trauma persists. <!-- I've read former cocaine and heroin addicts anecdotally report that long-term benzo neurotoxicity involves more horrific suffering than withdrawal from cocaine or heroin. --> 

I saw anecdotes [in this website](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadPill/) from former addicts of heroin or cocaine who were on benzos, who reported that those side effects and withdrawals <!-- of benzo-induced GABA downregulation --> were worse than the side effects and withdrawals that they had suffered from heroin or cocaine (and similar type anecdotal reports comparing the drugs elsewhere, e.g., probably abundant [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/), though at the surface hard to believe). I'm sure there isn't an experience on this Earth that is worse, humanly or cosmically possible (a year without sleep, non-stop neurochemical fire, not sure that's even imaginable). 

#### Teeth-Falling-Out Literal Nightmare

You know, the way I learned about the calcification was because chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out. Just chunks of tooth-like pieces from my mouth. So I went to the dental hygienist and she said it was de-calcification. This was already when I was starting to recover to some extent, when I was already on the steak-only diet. To reiterate: it started *de*-calcifying at that point. The calcification built up a lot during the 6 months I was on benzos. That was her diagnosis: calcification due to dry mouth from benzos. The steak-diet saved my teeth, I think.

`As if losing my hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, cognition, and skin weren't enough.`

#### Suicide Attempt

While I was living in the House on May St., and still in the early stages of my work, Henry wrote to me, “Ideas are cheap. Execution is hard." However, I have a pretty good track record of following through on my ideas. 

The benzos forced on me an idea that almost become too much of an "execution."

The risk of mortality was a foreseeable outcome <!--by my psychiatrists-->from benzos, [as published study data shows](https://thischangedmypractice.com/long-term-benzodiazepine-mortality-schizophrenia/), that suicide is a probable risk <!--in long-term benzo usage of patients presenting symptoms similar to mine--> in the symptomatic context that was included in my medical record.

During this time, my mom found and my family took away the helium tank connected to tubing I was going to kill myself with.

The trauma I went through during my psychosis (which the psychiatrists didn't even know about, and the description of which is omitted in this version of the book, so far) doesn't compare to the upwards of a year of benzo neurochemical torture that was induced on me. 

### Machinery Behind the Curtain

- The drug empire was disguised as the University of Rochester.
- The drug dealers were disguised as the University of Rochester's psychiatrists.
- The benzo drug market is a $3 billion industry disguised as the University of Rochester's medicine. 

Suspiciously, there were even contradictions in recent studies from previous decades, on the same drugs: ["the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Britain agreed in 1982 that there should be large-scale studies to examine the long-term impact of benzodiazepines after research by a leading psychiatrist showed brain shrinkage in some patients similar to the effects of long-term alcohol abuse."](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light) The study was buried: ["The only problem with the MRC's response to such warnings about benzos? It appears to have sat for thirty years on the very documents that warned about the risks of brain shrinkage in patients taking them. Moreover, the MRC appears to have marked the documents 'closed until 2014,' despite their obvious importance to public health. [...] 'Members of Parliament and lawyers,' she continues, 'described the recently revealed documents as a scandal, and predicted they could lead the way to a class action costing millions.'"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light)

What could've caused three psychiatrists, with zero consensus between each other, and zero consent from the patient, to cause so much damage? I suspect the >5 months of inconsistent psychiatrist and doctor plans were due to the self-reinforcing biases clinicians (in the general sense) can create in themselves as they change a patient's personality through chemical interventions. My personality started very charming and cheerful due to the benzos, at which point they still planned to wean me off within the hospital. Then fear and anxiety rose due to increasing downregulation. As those induced neurological changes "doctored" my perception and psyche, my believability lessened (due solely to reduced neurological function, not any fundamental behavioral change aside from mental impairment, and no catatonia, or mania, or delusion), and each changing shift of psychiatrists extended the asserted duration of the coerced prescription of the previous, changing the plans of the previous psychiatrists, culminating with the outpatient doctor only willing to increase, with no taper schedule on the planned horizon. Doctors are aggressively playing Gods, and have no understanding of the severe bias that their own interventions produce in their own or each other's clinical decision-making. Measurement-bias is a known problem in science. Detection can result in a change in the state of the physical system (or organism or body) being detected. In medicine, this problem is less widely understood since the subjects being observed, detected, analyzed, judged, and changed are people.

> To do: remove redundant information below about how my grandma got dementia chapter, and move additional relevant information from here there.

As these months progressed, my [facial structure changed, wrinkled and my face rapidly lost healthy appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), so much so as even my advisor remarked, empathetically, "You look terrible." Measuring damages to an intelligent person's intelligence fully is impossible. I was able to get straight A's in my grad level classes, TA a class, and pass an area exam in the time that I was brain damaged, even worse than I'm describing now. And that took a lot of resourcefulness, will, and spirit, like Matt-Damon-potatoes-on-Mars kind of human spirit, that can't be underestimated. But if *those* grad-level metrics can't measure the damage to my cognitive functioning, how could the tests that psychiatric researchers who believe benzos "can be safely taken for years"<!-- have-->? My grandma, in her early and later dementia, passed every test, like picking between two index cards about a color previously shown or reciting numbers that the doctor had just cited, and unambiguously to both family *and doctors* had dementia, dementia, the worst possible case scenario of this, and one that [studies have also shown benzos contribute to the likelihood of in elderly people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325366/)—and for that matter, how have any psychiatric research protocols evaluated whether somebody taking benzos in their 20s doesn't contribute to the likelihood of their dementia in their 80s? My family is intelligent, and we have a lot of will to work really hard. My friend, who was triple-majoring at the University of Rochester, told me she was driving once on acid. I was like, "Really, how?" and she said, "It's mostly muscle memory..." In other words, even under an extraordinarily altered state of consciousness, like the kind induced by acid, she would still plausibly be able to pass a driving test, and the same is true for drugs that alter one's consciousness, body, and neurology harmfully. No existing set of tests can measure how much an intelligent person's life, personality, cognition, and everything by which they live by, can be destroyed by the damages that psychiatric drugs cause which are hard to articulate and express in the midst of subjectively, even when those damages are extremely overt, and are incredibly insidious to the "more objective" tests that psychiatric researchers have, tests that try to come up with a metric for intelligence, the solution to which (used as a label source for a differentiable discriminator) would literally solve all of AI. 

ChatGPT, perhaps itself a wizard behind the curtain—an artificial program—could pass their human cognition or psychiatric tests with flying pixels, probably better than a human in good health.

Until recently, [lobotomies](https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy) and [conversion therapies](https://time.com/6344824/how-common-is-conversion-therapy-united-states/) were standard psychiatric practice. Coercion in psychiatric medicine, especially long-term, especially of benzos will be recognized by medicine as barbaric.

As it turns out, the disorder was with the psychiatrists all along. "Toto, we're not in Xanax anymore," the University of Rochester medical system says to itself, as it peddles more big pharma flying monkeys. When the prison guards are criminals and the prisoners are saints, things are backwards. Likewise, when the doctors are drug dealers and the patients would be regarded in Tibet or other cultures as showing early signs of shamanic intuitions (as both Jeremiah and Sarah did, I later came to learn from direct undeniable experience with them, and as [others who presented similar symptoms to mine](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) did, myself included), there's a disorder *of* the system, and it's not one that's classified in the DSM-5.

### Beginnings of Recovery

I had to buy waist straps to finally start to recover because I couldn't sit up from the debilitated position I shook with anxiety in on the couch.

The steak diet, which I began after the severest of these symptoms and withdrawing from benzos, in spring, 2020, helped my cognitive-energy-mood recovery.

And after all of this, [literally nothing was cured](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/kvbjhs/does_anyone_feel_physically_moved_by_some/). Which reality—theirs, wherein the conditions that lead to hospitalization are accidents that need to be militantly defeated (wherein meditation, yoga, good social life, intelligence, healthy Paleo diet, and maybe even an antipsychotic wouldn't suffice), or mine, wherein their practices are full of "psychiatric disorder" (and, as ever more abundantly shown, more than just psychiatric, but environmental, dietary, social, and more)—makes more sense?

### "Medical Leave"

Before my recovery<!-- from the benzos-->, I built the disease prognostication website. I wouldn't be emphasizing this so much if not for the outcome of my PhD that will be discussed in future chapters, but it was my idea that I had to argue for, build, and prove to convince them it was a good idea. Through brain damage, I built it, proved the concept to bosses and other researchers through hard work and an actual prototype, and presented it at a conference in DC where I had to retake a dose of benzos once to cognitively function. They took the idea after liking my version, they gave me no credit, not even for arguing for it<!--convincing them--><!-- it was a good idea-->, and they hired their own team to build it with plans for patenting. <!--I believe, at this time though, Henry had aranged them as the source of my funding via the "Udall Center grant," "designed to support innovation and discovery in Parkinson's Disease."-->

The next semesters, my classes were okay<!-- or coercive. I had to take Program Synthesis with Sri Pai, a professor I really like. It was still hard. B- was from a different systems professor, for which the story is quite bad. A fraction of a point, separated me from a B, even after I came into his office and he was ready to bump it up, he probably wasn't satisfied with the lack of flying colors I had and didn't believe me that my work would involve systems, and at the end of the meeting, decided to leave my grade at a B- for Operating Systems, and because I got a B-, in Operating Systems, like 0.1 of a point difference from B (since it would be rounded up), I had to retake a grad-level systems class, since PhD students are required to get a B or higher. A was Program Synthesis, the class I chose to meet the retake requirement, in which I educated Sree and the class about deep learning (AI) for program synthesis, the state of the art in that field (though at the time wasn't), got an A for his appreciation and my good teaching, and in all honesty, though I like Sree, did did more teaching than learning in this class I had to take by my earlier professor's bad faith. Systems is my least favorite field, but Sree's Parallel and Distributed Systems class, a different class, was the first and only systems class I ever liked-->. 

<!--So in other words I was coerced to take a class that turned out okay because I "got to" teach it with a professor I liked from yet a different systems class, because a different systems professor fell on the fence of deciding I had to do a semester of more grad-level systems work due to that ~0.1 fraction of a point and not believing my efforts to make the case that my own research would involve systems work, after our meeting. I mention this though because it recurs again many semesters later when my research ended up having to involve novel systems research due to new committee member's suggestions, that I did, that went unappreciated even worse than my argument to the B- one that my research later would (see ["Chris Kanan"](#chris-kanan)).-->

Sree introduced me to [Piazza](#kids), which is a great educational tool.

And in Spring, 2020, I worked in the office at the Med Center as my brain was just barely entering the first vestiges of recovery. I was [coming into the Med Center office regularly, working on the disease prognostication data and models on-site, and exercising again.](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/ShD9b4SeSA9Ebzbq/) 

### Termination Likely if Actual Medical Leave When Most Needed

<!--Had I taken a medical leave at the peak of this, and where the work was most intense, throughout the Spring, 2019 semester, I would've lost my salary, and wouldn't have been able to return for a long time, since the benzo brain damage was just getting started, in which case I most likely would've lost my health insurance, been delayed on [classes, TAship, and the area exam](5-Benzo-Torture.md)--><!-- (a many-page paper and oral defense, for which a master's degree is awarded, the biggest defense other than the thesis)--><!--, for yet another year at least (not to mention the time to write it), and, given [Henry's tenuous status having announced his intention to accept a directorship offer from the NSF](#red-light-at-clover-st), most likely would've been terminated for still having to do all of those things and not having an advisor, seeing as my next advisor, Chenliang, [would not have](#chenliang-xu) accepted me if I still had to do all of those things and had neither a published paper nor an area exam and resultant master's degree under my belt.--> <!--So taking a medical leave wasn't even an opportunity afforded me during the highest peak of the induced suffering by the same institution.-->

> ### Buffy
>
> In high school, I loved Lost, and Community, and Better Off Ted, and at some point Reaper, a show no one's heard of<!-- (well, I guess Reaper was middle school)-->. But my favorite-favorite has been Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which at the time was available on Netflix. I was obsessed.<!--, as well as with [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog](https://youtu.be/Of9kHpCv1ts?si=FPBQagGV-MX0BOK4).-->
>
> Almost nobody heard of Buffy in my high school, 2009 - 2013, Golden Age Peak TV era. I had a debate with my friend, another film buff, where I claimed TV shows were better than movies. He didn't believe me yet. In my high school, all those TV shows were getting missed<!--, at least by many of the people I talked to-->. Buffy had been out since the 90s/early 2000s, and was the most—maybe universally at my high school—unappreciated.
>
> The first person who took my recommendation got through multiple seasons, on my repeated insistence, and still didn't like it.
>
> It wasn't until my senior year I met somebody who liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I met him because he commented on a friend's Facebook post about a totally different shared interest, and I messaged him, he wanted to hang out to my surprise, and then he invited me to his birthday party. There, I met other kids who went to his school, including the other Buffy fan I met in high school, one of his friends who walked right up to me with a big smile and was so enthusiastic about my Buffy love. 
>
> Two of the first friends I made in college, by extreme coincidence, loved nerdy shows, especially Joss Whedon shows and Buffy, and were the <!-- girls--> people in my neighboring dorm. One of them later told me she didn't like Buffy that much. Her girlfriend however was such a big Buffy fan that she even made me feel guilty for not knowing some trivia about one of the episodes. The other one was one of the only people I ever watched Buffy together with. They both became my best friends that semester and I half-lived in their dorm. The other dorm near ours also housed <!--a girl--> someone who liked Buffy a lot, by chance. I was roomed near them by the university's random selection. Extreme Buffy fandom wasn't *that* common in college.
>
> Buffy appreciation, quite honestly, was how I measured intelligence then. Wealth and higher education, though, also seemed to increase likelihood of Buffy fandom, but not so as to without further Buffy-factor predict intelligence. It was a big surprise to me to meet those people in the private school, and then more people in college, with an appreciation for the shows I appreciated. It was literally surreal.
>
> I was so nervous with the first group, and regret missing the chance to bond more with them. The second group didn't make sense to me, but I was surrounded, and there was no escape from the universe giving me a good social life.
>
> From college to PhD, I didn't know Henry's favorite show was Buffy.
> 
> I was accepted as his PhD student not knowing that. I found out two semesters into the PhD program, and was kind of shocked. He said he was "obsessed with" Buffy, which he added is "kind of weird." I dropped off my "Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale" book, with a kind note, in his mailbox as a gift, re-gifting it from my best friend.
>
> Henry had a rare taste for something that others hadn't heard of as much, that would later contribute to the creation of something everybody has heard of. Joss Whedon created Buffy, and later wrote The Avengers, exploding from esoteric-nerdom to Blockbuster-God-man to cancelled-bad-man. Interestingly, Henry quipped and talked in a way reminiscent to Joss Whedon, and had theater writing experience, though as my advisor, Henry was more like Giles, Buffy's Watcher (advisor). Similarly, the method that I had a rare appreciation for, MHDPA, that had gone on to transformer-roll-out into being ChatGPT, would, much like Marvel movies, destroy civilization.
>
> Back in high school, all the best shows got cancelled, for which Joss Whedon was notorious, because of Firefly. So, so as to distinguish both of us from bad movie execs and producers, I am adding this paragraph just to say that I am not cancelling Henry.


Henry, who at the time was the Director for the Institute of Data Science at the University of Rochester, got an offer to be the Director of AI at the National Science Foundation, which is an extremely, extremely, extra-prestigious role. So he accepted, initially advised me while directing at the NSF in Washington, DC, after about half a year started planning to give up being my advisor, reassured me that his knowledge of deep learning specifically wasn't good enough anyway, and instructed me to switch to Chenliang Xu as my next advisor, who gave me an ultimatum about joining.

<!--
Compared the threat of AI to thinking about "traffic regulation on Mars"

"Traffic regulation on mars" quote can frame how that’s what Henry’s NSF directorship job in DC was, while he neglected to see through his final student to the completion of his degree. 
-->

Henry thought Chenliang would be better due to his having more experience in deep learning, but may have overestimated how much any professor at our CS department could afford me in terms of anything related to research and methods. Chenliang, for example, who was working on state of the art Computer Vision, had about as much familiarity with MHDPA in 2020 as Dan Gildea had in 2018, perhaps a little more. Before I was his student, in 2020, I presented using MHDPA on image features as an encoder architecture for Semantic Segmentation to him, on his whiteboard, with an explanatory diagram in my journal for what MHDPA was that I showed him, and a diagram on the whiteboard for my proposed Semantic Segmentation method. Chenliang, as many Computer Vision professors didn't, didn't know much, if at all, what MHDPA was until Vision Transformers gained popularity in 2021.

<!--
Chenliang was younger than Henry, a good amount closer to my age than Henry's, and didn't have tenure yet, though he acquired it [a couple years after accepting me into his lab. ]() -->

<!-- He got tenure in that time, and had his son in that time. -->

Chenliang's real contribution was having GPUs, something I missed the deadline for while under Henry, as I had been given access to the NSF's for my honorable mention in the GRFP I applied to, but only if I made an account within a specified time window, right in the middle of my benzo withdrawal, that I missed.

, at which point he wanted to reallocate funding to someone else with a faster publication rate, with short notice. -->

I managed to publish 2 papers under Chenliang. <!--The number of papers published by Henry's--> Henry's average student paper count was 1 - 3 across the PhD student's full 5 - 7 years. 
<!--
Chenliang had no other problems or qualms with me, the second professor to abandon his advising responsibility, this time with far less justification, seeing as Henry believed it would be best for me to have an advisor with deep learning experience, and had a stated intention, though unverified, to fund me himself if all else failed.
-->

Until Henry's retirement in 2022, which he didn't warn me about and came to me as a surprise from Chenliang, he stayed on as my PhD committee member.

To this day, Henry hasn’t acknowledged that what I was arguing to him about, had implemented, and had innovated on in 2018—MHDPA, the method that underpins transformers such as those used in AI models like ChatGPT—was worth crediting me for to any of the other faculty, committee members, or future committee members, including those who exploited my work or ruled me negatively in the years to come. In other words, he hasn’t said "Wow, our student was incredibly right!" or anything <!--meaningfully crediting me-->to that effect, despite the huge foresight and work delivered to him by his own student before even 5 groups in the world had used the method, let alone every iPhone and AI research lab and AI foundation model, as has become the case now.
